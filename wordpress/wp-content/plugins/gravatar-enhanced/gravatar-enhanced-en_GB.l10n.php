*What\'s a Gravatar?*

Your Gravatar (a Globally Recognized Avatar) is an image that follows you from site to site appearing beside your name when you do things like comment or post on a blog. Avatars help identify your posts on blogs and web forums, so why not on any site?

Thanks for visiting and come back soon!
